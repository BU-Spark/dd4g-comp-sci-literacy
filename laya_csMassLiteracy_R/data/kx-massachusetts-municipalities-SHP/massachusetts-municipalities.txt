Description:
  The political boundary datalayer is a polygon representation of town boundaries
  created from arcs developed from survey coordinates extracted from the 68-volume
  Harbor and Lands Commission Town Boundary Atlas for the 351 communities (cities
  and towns) in Massachusetts. The Atlas was published in the early 1900's and is
  maintained by the Survey Section of Massachusetts Highway Department. For
  communities with a coastal boundary, MassGIS has collaborated with Massachusetts
  Water Resources Authority and the Department of Environmental Protection to
  complete a 1:12000 scale coastline. The boundary for the coastline was defined
  as being the upland side of tidal flats and rocky inter-tidal zones. Note that
  the 351 communities are the official municipal names, not including "villages"
  or other sections of towns.
