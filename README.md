Data Days For Good

# How to use:

1. Branch from `main` using a branch named after your project. For example `computer-science-literacy`.
2. Once you've checked out your new branch, add a folder at the root level that is named after your project.
3. Under this folder, store all your code, sub-folders, assetts etc. Nothing should be placed in the root directory.
4. Push changes to your branch, not `main`
